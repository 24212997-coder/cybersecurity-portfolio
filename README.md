.0# My Cybersecurity Portfolio

## 1. About Me
Hello! My name is WU QI. I am a student currently studying Cyber Security. I am passionate about network security and solving technical challenges.
## 2. Technical Skills
* **Networking:** Cisco Packet Tracer, TCP/IP, Subnetting, Syslog, NetFlow.
* **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu command line), Windows.
* **Security Tools:** Nmap, Basic Network Auditing tools.
## 3. Certifications and Training
* **Coursework:** WQE7001 Cyber Security (University of Malaya).
* **Workshops:** Practical training in Network Logging and Linux Security Troubleshooting.
## 4. Project Experience
### Project 1: Packet Tracer - Logging from Multiple Sources
* **Objective:** configured Syslog, NTP, and NetFlow to monitor network events effectively and timestamp logs accurately.
* **Tools:** Cisco Packet Tracer, Syslog Server, AAA Server, NTP Server.
* **Methodology:** Enabled timestamp service on routers, pointed devices to the Syslog server, and verified log reception.
* **Outcome:** Successfully centralized network logs, allowing for easier auditing and issue tracking.
### Project 2: Linux Network Troubleshooting
* **Objective:** Diagnosed and resolved internet connectivity issues on a Linux server.
* **Tools:** Linux Terminal (Ubuntu), ip utilities.
* **Methodology:** Used `ip addr` to check interface status, `ip route` to verify gateway settings, and `ping` to test connectivity. Identified a missing default gateway.
* **Outcome:** Restored network access and verified stable connection to external servers.
## 5. Learning Journey
Throughout this course, I have gained a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles and network defense.
* **Progress:** I have significantly improved my practical skills in configuring network devices (switches/routers) and navigating Linux environments via the command line.
* **Challenges:** Initially, I found command-line interfaces (CLI) challenging compared to graphical interfaces. However, through assignments like network troubleshooting, I have become more confident and efficient.
* **Future Plans:** I aim to deepen my knowledge in penetration testing and learn more about automating security tasks with Python.
## 6. Career Objective
My goal is to start a career as a Cybersecurity Analyst or Network Security Engineer. I aspire to work in a dynamic environment where I can apply my skills to secure enterprise infrastructures and mitigate emerging cyber threats.
